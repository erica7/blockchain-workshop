Exercise 2 - BrewChain

This exercise is to test usage of all the members of BrewChain.  BrewChain returns the following members:
```
{
    init,
    createBlock,
    addToChain,
    checkNewBlockIsValid,
    getLatestBlock,
    getTotalBlocks,
    getChain
}
```
The test suite [test.js](/test.js) has a number of tests to exercise all the exposed members of BrewChain.  The tests are marked where you should fill them out.

- Change to this directory and run `npm install`
- Fill in the code in `test.js`
  - Look for `// TODO:`
  - `{}` are placeholders for objects you should create.
- Verify your code with `npm run test`.
- Proceed to [Step 3](../03_brewnode)
